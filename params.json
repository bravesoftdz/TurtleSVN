{"name":"Turtlesvn","tagline":"A cross-platform SVN client","body":"### Welcome to TurtleSVN.\r\nTurtleSVN is a cross-platform alternative for managing SVN repositories. Currently TurtleSVN comes with its own file browser, but in time extensions will be made for the default file browsers and IDE's on all major platforms.\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\nTurtleSVN is easy to use as it wraps the SVN commands in a graphical environment. It allows you to combine certain actions like for instance adding and committing at the same time and gives feedback on errors and required actions. TurtleSVN also comes with a diff viewer.   \r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nTurtleSVN is seeking for fellow developers that would like to contribute to the project. This can range from simple tasks like creating builds for the different platforms and simple fixes and improvements up to the more difficult or elaborate functionality improvement. Just send out a message to @daar for more info. TurtleSVN is written in Freepascal - Lazarus.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with TurtleSVN?
