# TurtleSVN
A cross-platform desktop application that manages SVN repositories.

The need for this application was born out of the frustration that no application similar to TortoiseSVN was available. TortoiseSVN is one of the best applications that is fully integrated in the Windows explorer. However sadly it's only for Windows available.

TurtleSVN is now still not integrated in file browsers for the different platforms but rather a standalone application. The goal is to get to there at some point in time. The SVN functionality was first developed as a Lazarus IDE addin, but it was easy to convert that to a stand alone application.

Once TurtleSVN has reached a point of maturity (aka fully usable state) I will attempt to create plugins for GNOME files, Windows Explorer and OS X Finder.
